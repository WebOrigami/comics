    Everybody has something to say, and **the web** is a great place to say it.

    Having **your own site** is especially important in a world increasingly
    dominated by exploitative tech platforms.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    But creating an interesting site can be **hard or expensive**. Let’s compare
    some of your choices.

    The web itself is made from **HTML and CSS**, and it’s actually possible to
    write those file formats by hand.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    You can publish HTML and CSS files on a number of services, many of which
    are **inexpensive or free**.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    But most sites have too much **repetition** to write every bit of HTML by hand!

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    And it’s hard to efficiently organize a collection of pages into a
    **coherent, navigable site**.

- actor: Alice

  narration: >
    Corporate **site hosting platforms** offer nice drag-and-drop editors and
    many useful features, so they’re great for busy or non-technical people.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    But they impose **creative limitations** and high monthly costs.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    Depending on how much you want to reach your audience, a monthly cost can be
    acceptable, but **that cost is forever**. Stop paying, and your site
    disappears!

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    Hosting platforms also have a vested interest in hiding from you how they
    actually work and making it hard to **move your own content** somewhere
    else.

    You could program a site **from scratch** — if you master a full programming
    language like JavaScript and a wide range of technical concepts.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    Many frameworks exist to help you create a site, promising **simplicity**
    and an instant site.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    But frameworks paper over a great deal of hidden **complexity**. Much of
    their value comes from **not** asking you to understand what you’re making.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    All that complexity is exposed the minute you want to **get creative** and
    add something they didn’t anticipate.

- actor: Alice
  face: default
  narration: >
    Depending on who you are and what you want to make, **any** of these choices
    might be appropriate.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    But maybe you want another way to create a **substantial, expressive site**
    at low cost and without entanglements.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    The **Web Origami** project might be for you if you're making a site for
    yourself or a small organization…

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    and can write some **HTML and CSS**…

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    and prefer to **fully understand** how your site gets made so you can always
    change it as your ideas for it evolve.
