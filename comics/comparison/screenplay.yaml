    Everybody has something to say, and **the web** is a great place to say it.

    Having **your own site** is especially important in a world dominated by
    exploitative social media platforms.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    But creating your own site can be **hard or expensive**. Let’s compare some
    of your choices.

    The web itself is made from **HTML and CSS**, and it’s actually possible to
    write those file formats by hand.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    You can publish HTML and CSS files on a number of services, many of which
    are **inexpensive or free**.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    But most sites have too much **repetition** to write every bit of HTML by hand!

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    And changing the organization of your site requires **changing every page**.

    Corporate **site hosting platforms** offer nice drag-and-drop editors and
    useful features, so they're appealing for many projects.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    But they also impose **creative limitations** and high monthly costs.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    Depending on how much you want to reach your audience, a monthly cost can be
    reasonable, but **that cost is forever**. Stop paying, and your site
    disappears!

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    Hosting platforms also have a vested interest in obscuring how they work and
    making it hard to **export your own content** to somewhere else.

    You could program a site from scratch — if you master a **full programming
    language** like JavaScript and a wide range of technical concepts.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    Many programmers rely on a **framework** to help them build a site.
    Frameworks promise **simplicity** and fast results.

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    But frameworks hide a great deal of **complexity** — you can get a site
    right away, but not have any idea how it works!

- actor: Bob
  narration: >
    That complexity becomes an obstacle the minute you change your mind or want
    to **get creative** and add something the framework didn’t anticipate.

- actor: Alice

  narration: >
    Depending on who you are and what you want to make, **any** of these choices
    might be appropriate.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    But maybe you want another way to create a **substantial, expressive site**
    at low cost and without entanglements.

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    The **Web Origami** project might be for you if you're making a site for
    yourself or a small organization…

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    and can write some **HTML and CSS**…

- actor: Alice
  narration: >
    and prefer to **fully understand** how your site gets made so you can always
    change it as your ideas evolve.
